## Description

We found a voice recording in one of the forensic images but we have no clue what's the voice recording about. Are you able to help?

## Solution

<br>

We tried using “turgen system” to extract out a hidden file but turns out it was the wrong program. Afterwards, we tried using “Sonic Visualiser” and found an image with a base64 hash written on it when we added a spectrogram to all channels.

We manually typed the base64 hash out ( aHR0cHM0_y9wYXN0ZWJpbi5jb20vakVUajJ1VWI= ).


Even though the hash we typed out wasn’t 100% the same we manage to make out a link to a pastebin.

We went to the pastebin link and found a programming language that has been obfuscated called brainfuck.

Using https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language we decode the encrypted text and gotten "thisisnottheflag" but this was not the flag.

Using the hint from the question we did more research on xiao and added steganography when searching for answers on google. We found a software called xiao steganography

We proceeded to download the software.

We clicked on the second option, Extract Files and import the wav file by click on “Load Source file”.

Then we clicked “Next” and found that there was a zip file hidden in the wav file. However in order to extract it, we had to input a password. Using the plaintext we got from decoding brainfuck (thisisnottheflag) , we used it as the password to extract the file.

When opening the extracted zip file, we found that the zip file is password protected. In the zip file there is a word document.

Initially, we thought we need to do some data carving on the zip file but after throwing the file into a hex editor we found the password written in it.

Using the password we gotten, we open the word document and the flag was there.
